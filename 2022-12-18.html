              <p>As it goes with any creative endeavor, the vision at the start can sometimes fail to resemble the finished product. And that's often a good thing! The best products are relentlessly refined over and over again with numerous missteps along the way. I truly believe that's how great things become so great. While I originally imagined a more frequent posting schedule for this blog, it's pretty clear that bar was too high for me (my <a class="cursor-pointer text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500 underline" href="./hello_world.html">last post</a> was over 6 months ago). C'est la vie. I venture on anyway!</p>
              <p>Over the past 6 months, I've gone back and forth on the title for this blog. While the current one is similar, the original title was "Objective-C(asey)" with a subtitle of "Adventures in Mac Programming." While I still like the throwback to Objective-C and the <i><a class="cursor-pointer text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500 underline" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/WhatIsCocoa/WhatIsCocoa.html">old way</a></i> of programming for Apple platforms, I'm hardly an authority on the topic. In fact, I'm far from it. Who am I kidding? I've never written a Mac app. I barely know Objective-C (although I've enjoyed <a class="cursor-pointer text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500 underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AppleProgramming">learning</a> for fun). Something just didn't feel right. It wasn't authentic. As much as I <i>want</i> to be an expert on the topic, I'm not quite there yet, and I'm not in the business of fooling people. I do have a unique perspective in some ways, though. I really <i>like</i> the Mac. And I admire Apple in general. I've also been programming professionally for six or so years. There has to be <i>something</i> there, right? So, how can I broaden my scope of potential topics, while also keeping a somewhat specific niche?</p>
              <p>Well... I dropped the "Mac" in the subtitle. As silly as it is, I feel like it really takes the pressure off of thinking about topic ideas. Imagining a <i>slightly</i> more general audience allows me to think more freely about what I want this to become. Still nerdy programming stuff (and let's be honest, still probably about Apple), just less specific. I also took my name out of the title. I don't have a good explanation for doing this— it just felt right. The new title, "@objcturtle", now serves multiple purposes. It's obscure enough to be available on all the social things (and as a domain), so I can have the same handle everywhere without adding random numbers at the end. It still contains the reference to Objective-C that I was originally going for, albeit now with a bit more subtlety. And lastly, it includes the name of an <a class="cursor-pointer text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-500 underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle">animal</a> that perfectly encapsulates the rate at which I've been making progress on this project!</p>
              <p>Here's to new ideas and more reasonable expectations, all with the same lofty nerd goals. Maybe I'll even write a post related to programming next time! What a thought.</p>
